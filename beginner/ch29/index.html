		<h4>What Matters in This Section</h4>
		<p>
			That's a more tough one for programming beginners. But I guess with computer science background, this should be
			easy, now that JavaScript has evolved. I remember the old way, and it was a pain

		<h4>What On Earth are Prototypes</h4>
		<p>Prototype is property of an object which got inherited. Like an array who gets all array functions everytime
			an array is created. You can give objects like arrays their own methods, but it will not be inherited on a new
		array.
			<br>That's actually a nice way to look up all the functions an Object has in the console:
			<code>String.prototype</code>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Intro to Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
		<p>That Color class Colt is using as an example could really become handy</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Factory Functions</h4>
		<p>This means a function that creates objects. It feels like a strange way to write an own constructor, but no
			<code>new</code>-keyword and always creating a new object calling that method</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Constructor Functions</h4>
		<p>Yeah, like I thought. Colt was kinda trying to write a constructor in the last video. I don't get the idea
			though. He now says, that you wouldn't do that that way.
			<br>This is still not the right way, because you can only write a constructor and need do define that method to
			the prototype: <code>Color.prototype.rgb</code>. It's kinda weird. I would prefer Classes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>JavaScript Classes</h4>
		<p><code>constructor()</code> is the constructor function. It's sometimes different in other programming
			languages. Methods don't need the <code>function</code> keyword.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>More Classes Practice</h4>
		<p></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Extends and Super Keywords</h4>
		<p>Just like you would expect if you programmed OOP before. Overloading is possible</p>
